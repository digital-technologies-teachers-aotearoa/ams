## What is AMS?

Association Management Software (AMS) is a comprehensive, open-source platform designed specifically for membership associations, professional bodies, clubs, and community organizations.
Built by the Digital Technologies Teachers Aotearoa (DTTA) for their own operational needs, AMS provides everything required to manage a modern association in one integrated system.

Unlike fragmented solutions that require multiple separate platforms for membership management, billing, content publishing, and community engagement, AMS delivers an all-in-one solution.
Whether you are managing individual memberships, organization-based memberships with seat allocation, or hybrid models, AMS handles the complexity while providing a seamless experience for both administrators and members.

Developed with New Zealand associations in mind, AMS includes native support for Xero accounting integration, and bilingual content (English and Te Reo Māori), while remaining flexible enough to serve associations worldwide.

## Key Features

### All-in-One Solution

AMS consolidates essential association management functions into a single platform, eliminating the need to integrate and maintain multiple separate systems. Members access everything through one unified portal with single sign-on authentication across all services.
